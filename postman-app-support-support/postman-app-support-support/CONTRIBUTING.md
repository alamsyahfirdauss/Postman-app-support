## Guidelines for reporting issues

We have put together a short set of guidelines you can follow while adding an issue to our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues). Following the information in this guide will help us to trige the issues quickly, reduce the feedback loop and ensure a speedy resolution.

1. This issue tracker is only for the Postman App and Web platform related issues. If you have `Newman` specific issues, a better place to report them would be the [Newman issue tracker](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman/issues).

2. If you are facing a specific account related issue and you want to include personal information such as your username or collection names, reach out to us by submitting a ticket on our [support page](https://support.postman.com/).

3. If you want to report a security issue in any of Postmanâ€™s services or products, read our [security reporting guidelines and policy](https://www.postman.com/vulnerability-reporting) for more details.

4. For answers to questions along the lines of _"How do I... in Postman"_ should be in our online documentation at [https://learning.postman.com/](https://learning.postman.com/). If you are unable to find a how-to guide in our online documentation, feel free to ask your question on our [Postman Community Forum](https://community.postman.com).

5. Before reporting an issue, please use the search feature on the issues page to check if there are issues similar to yours. A lot of issues are duplicates, and it is hard to keep track of them or respond when the issues are solved. If you find your issue already reported, feel free to add a "thumbs up" reaction or provide a comment on the open issues thread.

6. When reporting a new issue in the issue tracker, check whether it helps to answer the following questions:

   - Which Postman App or Web platform and Operating System version you are using. You can check this out in the _Settings icon in the top right > Settings > About_ section.

   - Is the bug reproducible every time, or do you see it occasionally? Provide the full steps to reproduce the problem.

   - Did you first encounter it recently, or has it always been there?

   - If it is a UI issue, a full app screenshot or GIF/short video clip will help tremendously. (Tip: For quick gifs, check out [licecap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/))
   
   - If the issue is related to a script in the sandbox, attach the full code snippet and ensure that this is formatted correctly using the code block [markdown syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) 

   - Include log details from the [Dev Tools window](https://support.postman.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025298633-How-to-collect-logs).
